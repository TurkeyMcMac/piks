.SH NAME
\fBpiks\fR - Run the evolution simulator piks


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpiks\fR [\fIoptions\fR]


.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBpiks\fR is an evolving life simulator.  Each animal, a "pik" or whatever, has
a direction as its state. It senses which of the eight cells around are alive,
like in Conway's Game of Life. Each animal also contains a pointer to a genome,
a table of the responses to each possible configuration (there are 256.) A
response can be one of the following:
.IP \[bu]
Move forward. This works only if the cell in front is empty.
.IP \[bu]
Turn right or left.
.IP \[bu]
Produce a baby. The cell in front must be alive, and the cell behind must be
dead. The animal in front is consumed, while the cell behind has the baby put in
it facing the direction opposite to the parent's. The baby has a small chance of
being a mutant, facilitating evolution.

.P

After starting the game, quit by pressing any key. If you are using
non-graphical mode and said key was not ENTER, press ENTER afterward. In any
case, the world will be saved upon quitting.


.SH OPTIONS

.IP "\fB-W\fR \fIwidth\fR"
Set the world width.

.IP "\fB-H\fR \fIheight\fR"
Set the world height.

.IP "\fB-i\fR \fIfile\fR"
Set the input world file.

.IP "\fB-o\fR \fIfile\fR"
Set the destination, where to write the world.

.IP "\fB-p\fR \fIpopulation\fR"
Set the population/number of species in the world.

.IP "\fB-r\fR \fIseed\fR"
Set the random seed for the world.

.IP "\fB-f\fR \fIFPS\fR"
Set the frames per second. The default is 30.

.IP \fB-G\fR
Turn graphics on. This is the default.

.IP \fB-g\fR
Turn graphics off. \fB-f\fR has no effect in this case.

.IP \fB-I\fR
Print world info and exit. All this information must be determinable by other
options such as \fB-i\fR, \fB-W\fR, etc.

.IP "\fB-s\fR \fIinterval\fR"
Save every \fIinterval\fR ticks. 0 means no saving except at the end. This is
the default.

.IP "\fB-S\fR \fIticks\fR"
Stop and save after <ticks> ticks.
.IP "\fB-h\fR"
Print this help and exit.

.IP "\fB-v\fR"
Print version information and exit.

.P

The options \fB-W\fR, \fB-H\fR, \fB-p\fR, and \fB-r\fR are only used if \fB-i\fR
is not provided. With no \fB-i\fR option, a new world is created rather than
loading one from a file. If \fB-o\fR is not provided but \fB-i\fR is, the file
specified by \fB-i\fR will also be written as the save location.


.SH EXIT STATUS

\fBpiks\fR exits with 0 on success or a non-zero value on any failure.
