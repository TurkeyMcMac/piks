PIKS
====
This is another life simulator. It is simpler than the other ones I've made.
Each animal, a "pik" or whatever, has a direction as its state. It senses which
of the eight cells around are alive, like in Conway's Game of Life. Each animal
also contains a pointer to a genome, a table of the responses to each possible
configuration (there are 256.) A response can be one of the following:
 * Move forward. This works only if the cell in front is empty.
 * Turn right or left.
 * Produce a baby. The cell in front must be alive, and the cell behind must be
   dead. The animal in front is consumed, while the cell behind has the baby put
   in it. The baby has a small chance of being a mutant, facilitating evolution.
