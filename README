PIKS
====
This is another life simulator. It is simpler than the other ones I've made.
Each animal, a "pik" or whatever, has a direction as its state. It senses which
of the eight cells around are alive, like in Conway's Game of Life. Each animal
also contains a pointer to a genome, a table of the responses to each possible
configuration (there are 256.) A response can be one of the following:
 * Move forward. This works only if the cell in front is empty.
 * Turn right or left.
 * Produce a baby. The cell in front must be alive, and the cell behind must be
   dead. The animal in front is consumed, while the cell behind has the baby put
   in it. The baby has a small chance of being a mutant, facilitating evolution.

INTERFACE
---------
Usage: ./piks [options]

Options:
  -W <width>       Set the world width.
  -H <height>      Set the world height.
  -i <file>        Set the input world file.
  -o <file>        Set the destination, where to write the world.
  -p <population>  Set the population/number of species in the world.
  -r <seed>        Set the random seed for the world.
  -f <FPS>         Set the frames per second. The default is 30.
  -G               Turn graphics on. This is the default.
  -g               Turn graphics off. -f has no effect in this case.
  -I               Print world info (width, height, population, version) and
                   exit. All this information must be determinable by other
                   options such as -i, -W, etc.
  -s <interval>    Save every <interval> ticks. 0 means no saving except at
                   the end. This is the default.
  -h               Print this help and exit.
  -v               Print version information and exit.
The options -W, -H, -p, and -r are only used if -i is not provided. With no -i
option, a new world is created rather than loading one from a file. If -o is not
provided but -i is, the file specified by -i will also be written as the save
location.

Runtime:
The only action which can be taken at runtime currently is quitting. Press any
key to save and exit.
